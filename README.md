# Login-Form-Validation
*This project features a simple yet functional login form with built-in validation to ensure that users enter valid credentials. The form includes fields for a username and password, with real-time validation and error messages for user feedback.*

Key Features:
Login Form Structure: The form is built using HTML and includes input fields for the username and password, along with a submit button.
Form Styling: The form is styled using CSS to create a clean and user-friendly interface. Error messages are also styled to appear clearly when validation fails.
Client-Side Validation: JavaScript functions are used to validate the input fields:
Ensure that the username and password fields are not empty.
Check that the password meets specific criteria (e.g., minimum length, contains numbers, special characters, etc.).
Display appropriate error messages if any validation rule is violated.
Responsive Design: The form is responsive and looks great on any device, from desktops to mobile screens.

Technologies Used:
HTML: For creating the structure of the login form and its input fields.
CSS: For styling the form, including error messages and responsive layout adjustments.
JavaScript: For validating the form inputs, checking if the username and password are correctly entered, and displaying feedback when there are errors.
